This was my very first attempt at coding anything, 
and I'm not gonna lie, it was way harder than I
thought.
"Coding Fury Road" had me on the edge of my seat
from start to finish.


   My fabulous tech journey has just set sail.
    I expect to encounter tougher challenges as
      I progress, but that won't faze me, 
        Cos I can only get better with
               more Practice!

Coding fury road included commands like these;

For the moment we have an empty project 
directory containing only a README.md. It’s time
 to code!

Inside 0x01-git:

Create these directories at the root of your
project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines
inside:#!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines
inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code
today, so cool”) and push to the remote server.
